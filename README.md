# Analog Clock Animation

This project is an animated 3D analog clock created using HTML and CSS. The clock features smooth animations for the hour, minute, second, and millisecond hands. The clock face has multiple layers to create a sense of depth, and it rotates slightly back and forth to enhance the 3D effect.

## Features

- **3D Animation**: The clock hands and face have smooth, continuous animations.
- **Depth and Perspective**: Uses multiple layers and CSS transformations to create a realistic 3D effect.
